# SDK Package Contract

`packages/sdk` owns the Rust SDK first. It provides typed client and transport helpers generated or validated from stable Overrid contracts.

Rules:

- Depend on `packages/schemas` as the contract authority.
- Preserve SDK/Overgate routing for control-plane calls; do not add direct internal service, queue, storage, node, or private-state paths.
- Keep TypeScript/web bindings as generated client projections outside this Rust SDK runtime.
- Keep test fixtures secret-free and aligned with shared schema versions.

This README is the Phase 2 package placeholder for the already implemented SDK crate.
